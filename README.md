# The Assessment
This assessment was build to validate your developer skills using our main stack (React + GraphQL). Keep in mind that UI and performance walk together to deliver the best experience.

Your main objective is to deliver a list of Pipes (sorted by name and paginated), with the number of cards that belong to it, loading more elements at an user's interaction (like a button click or scroll). Once the pipes are totally listed, we want to see a small user interaction to load all Pipe's cards in a button click, loading this information inside a modal;

You don't need to develop the best layout in this phase. Feel free to create your visual representation of Pipefy or replicate the visual structure that we already have.

### Visual Representation

**OBS: You don't need to develop the favorite and "add new pipe" interactions. Don't worry about the Pipe's icons.**

## What we will evaluate
- A semantic HTML;
- A well structured CSS (feel free to use any lib, preprocessor or pure CSS);
- How clean and readable your code is;
- Your vision about frontend's architecture;

## Bonus
- TypeScript usage;
- Unit and/or integration tests;
- Usage of a state management layer (like Redux, Mobx or even GraphQL cache);
- Functional programming approach;

# App Instructions

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run this App you will need to create a .env file and add these 2 variables in it:

```
REACT_APP_PIPEFY_API_URL=https://app.pipefy.com/queries
REACT_APP_PIPEFY_API_TOKEN=<API_TOKEN>
```

The `API_TOKEN` was sent in the same email that you received with this assessment's link.

## API
You can access our API documentation with the below link:

[Pipefy's GraphQL Playground](https://app.pipefy.com/graphiql)

## Tips
1. You can use the `organization` query to load all pipes. The other (cards) query is very simple to find in our documentation;
2. We already configured Apollo Provider for your;
3. Use the `@apollo/client` dependency to extract the `useQuery` hook, and the `gql`;  

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
